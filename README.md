# Discord Exploit Collection

A collection of both patched and unpatched bugs, exploits, API abuses and other strange and exploitable features and illusions in the Discord app.

CBA to make an overview. Just browse the repo.

## Some other unpatched exploits I haven't figured out how works yet

Let me know, if anything is missing or if you have any exploits, on my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/VtCxB5u)
